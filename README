This is smm, a library to read and manipulate .mm files used by the Metamath
System (http://us.metamath.org/).  It is written in Javascript, making fairly
important use of the ES6 Map and Set objects and much less important use of
several other ES6 features; currently only io.js 2 and d8 4.5 are known to
work.  It is distributed under the MIT license (LICENSE).

To install prerequisites and use smm to verify a set.mm file:

1. Install nvm from https://github.com/creationix/nvm (this will hack your
shell rcfile, and only works with Bourneish shells on Unix; if not Unix, skip
this step)

2. Install io.js 2+ and npm via "nvm install iojs" (Unix); (There is an
official io.js installer for Windows.  I have not tested this route.)

3. Download dependencies with "npm install" with the current directory as the
smm checkout

4. Run self-tests: node node_modules/.bin/jasmine

5. Use it: node misc/verify.js ../set.mm
